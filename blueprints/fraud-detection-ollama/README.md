# Fraud / AML Detection (Ollama, CPU)

A financial-crime / money-laundering / anomaly-detection blueprint. **Apache Airflow**
generates and manipulates a synthetic fraud graph, **trains an XGBoost classifier** on the
labelled data, and indexes behavioural feature vectors in **Milvus** for anomaly detection; a
local SUSE-styled investigator UI uses a local **LLM (Ollama, `qwen2.5:3b`)** as an **AML
analyst** to classify and explain flagged accounts.

This is the **CPU / Ollama** variant. For the **GPU / vLLM** variant (same pipeline, LLM
served by vLLM), see [`../fraud-detection-vllm`](../fraud-detection-vllm).

## Components (all from the SUSE Application Collection)

| Component | Chart | Role |
|-----------|-------|------|
| **Apache Airflow** | `apache-airflow` `1.22.0` | orchestrates generate → train → anomaly (DAGs via git-sync) |
| **PostgreSQL** | `postgresql` `0.6.0` (`fraud-db`) | accounts, transactions, labels, scores, flagged accounts |
| **Milvus** | `milvus` `5.0.22` | per-account behavioural feature vectors for anomaly detection |
| **Ollama** | `ollama` `1.55.0` | `qwen2.5:3b` — the AML analyst LLM, CPU |
| **Investigator UI** | — (local) | FastAPI + SUSE dashboard in [`ui/`](ui/), runs locally |

## Pipeline (Airflow DAGs, in [`dags/`](dags/))

1. **`generate_fraud_dataset`** — generate a synthetic fraud graph with
   `gen-fraud-graph` (accounts + transactions with injected **laundering rings**), size set by
   `SCALE_FACTOR` (default `0.001` ≈ 10k accounts / 90k tx), and load it into PostgreSQL.
2. **`engineer_and_train`** — build per-account graph/behavioural features (degrees, amount
   stats, high-value-edge counts, **high-value-cycle membership** via networkx), label from the
   ground-truth rings, **train XGBoost** (SMOTE for imbalance), batch-score all accounts, and
   record precision/recall/F1/AUC.
3. **`flag_and_anomaly`** — index normalised feature vectors in Milvus, compute an anomaly
   score (distance to nearest neighbours), and write the top **flagged accounts** (combining
   model score + anomaly + ring membership).
4. **`clear_data`** — reset everything.

The LLM then explains flagged cases on demand in the UI (typology, risk rationale, recommended
action) — the "ML score → LLM analyst" pattern.

## Use it via the Blueprint Marketplace (recommended)

Pick **Fraud / AML Detection (Ollama, CPU)** and follow the guide: import → create the
AIWorkload in AI Factory → run the three DAGs in Airflow → it starts the local UI +
port-forwards for you → investigate flagged accounts.

## Notes

- **Scale**: `SCALE_FACTOR` (Airflow `env` on the blueprint) controls dataset size. The demo
  default is tiny; raising it (and Airflow resources) is exactly why the pipeline is on Airflow.
- **Airflow image**: this blueprint uses the **upstream `apache/airflow:3.2.2`** image rather
  than the SUSE Application Collection one. The hardened SUSE image ships **without `pip`**, so
  `_PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS` (how we add the DAG's Python libraries) can't run on it —
  the upstream image includes `pip` + `git`. This one component therefore deviates from the
  all-SUSE story.
- **DAG dependencies** are installed at Airflow start via `_PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS`
  (pandas, networkx, scikit-learn, xgboost, imbalanced-learn, psycopg2-binary, gen-fraud-graph).
  This is demo-grade — the packages install on every pod start, so the first boot takes a few
  minutes. For production, **bake a custom Airflow image** (FROM apache/airflow:3.2.2 + `pip
  install …`) and point `images.airflow` at it, dropping `_PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS`.
- **Data stores**: transactions/labels/scores in PostgreSQL (`fraud-db`), anomaly vectors in
  Milvus. No graph database is required (ring detection runs in-DAG with networkx).
- The XGBoost model is trained + used for batch scoring inside Airflow (results in Postgres);
  interactive scoring of new transactions is a possible future addition.
